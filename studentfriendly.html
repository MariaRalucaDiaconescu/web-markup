            <h2>Medical insurance</h2>

            <img src="img/road-sign.png" title="Image with road sign" alt="Image with road sign to health" />

            <p>Having a medical insurance is not mandatory for the international students in the Netherlands. However,
                if you become employed, you will need an insurance.</p>

            <p> Depending on the price you pay for the insurance, it can cover most of the medical expenses or all of
                the expenses.</p>

            <p>At <a href="https://www.zilverenkruis.nl/consumenten/zorgverzekering/basisverzekering">Zilverenkruis</a> you can take out a medical insurance at prices ranging from 130€ to 155€. <em>Students
                    can get a discount of up to 25% of an additional insurance</em>. This is required for dentistry,
                glasses and lens. Its price can range from 2€ to 75€. </p>

            <p> While being a student you might never need the medical ensurance. But it can be useful for exemption
                from the courses, vaccination or if you have a dental problem. Otherwise, without medical insurance, the
                costs for medical services are very high.</p>
